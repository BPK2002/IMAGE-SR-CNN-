# Image Super-Resolution using Convolutional Neural Networks

Image Super-Resolution (SR) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a technique in computer vision that aims to enhance the resolution of an image, transforming a low-resolution image into a high-resolution version by learning the mapping between the two. CNN-based super-resolution methods have become very popular due to their ability to effectively capture the intricate details and textures of images.
